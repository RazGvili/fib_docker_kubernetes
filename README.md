*Part of a Docker course - "docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide" by the great Stephen Grider

Purpose
This app calculates the value of a Fibonacci value given an index of the series. Example: For the index 6 the value is 13.

CI
The master branch is integrated into TravisCI, a successful deploy must pass the react app tests. Used Docker-Compose to build the multi-container env, supports a development env with Dockerfile.dev per container.

App architecture
Nginx container
As proxy 

Client container
returns create-react-app static files 

*In production is wrapped with Nginx to serve static build files 

Express server container
API for Fibonacci calculations. Will save indices the app seen in a Postgress DB. The calculated values will first be saved as "ready", then will be passed to the worker container. 

Worker container
Listens to the saved Redis values (Pub/Sub), then calculates the Fibonacci value.
